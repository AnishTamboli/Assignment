        <h1><b><u><i>Marketing in Business: Strategies and Types</i></u></b></h1>
        <h2>What Is Marketing?</h2>
        <p>Marketing refers to the activities a company undertakes to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/top-stocks-4689741">promote</a> the buying or selling
        of its products or services. <br> Marketing includes advertising and allows businesses to 
        sell products and services to consumers, other businesses, and organizations.</p>
        <h2>Understanding Marketing</h2>
        <p>Marketing as a discipline involves all the actions a company undertakes to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/below-the-line-advertising.asp">draw in customers</a>
            and maintain relationships with them. <br> Networking with potential or past clients
             is part of the work too and may include writing thank you emails, playing golf with prospective clients, <br> 
            returning calls and emails quickly, and meeting with clients for coffee or a meal.
        </p>
        <h2>What Are the 4 P's of Marketing?</h2>
        <p>Product, price, place, and promotion are the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-ps.asp">Four Ps</a> of marketing.
        The Four Ps collectively make up the essential mix a company needs to market a product or service. 
          <br> Neil Borden popularized the idea of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing-mix.asp">marketing mix</a> and the concept of the Four Ps in the 1950s.</p>

          <h2>Product</h2>
          <p>Product refers to an item or items the business plans to offer to customers. 
            The product should seek to fulfill an absence in the market or fulfill consumer 
            demand for a greater amount of a product already available. Before they can prepare an appropriate campaign, 
            marketers need to understand what product is being sold, how it stands out from its competitors, 
            whether the product can also be paired with a secondary product or product line, 
            and whether there are substitute products in the market.</p>
            <h2>Price</h2>
            <p>Price refers to how much the company will sell the product for.
               When establishing a price, companies must consider the unit cost price, marketing costs, 
               and distribution expenses. Companies must also consider the price of competing products in the marketplace and whether 
                their proposed price point is sufficient to represent a reasonable alternative for consumers</p>
                <h2>Place</h2>
                <p>Place refers to the distribution of the product. Key considerations include whether the company
                     will sell the product through a physical storefront, online, or through both distribution channels.
                    When it's sold in a storefront, what kind of physical product placement does it get? 
                    When it's sold online, what kind of digital product placement does it get?</p>
                    <h2>Promotion</h2>
                   <p>Promotion, the fourth P, is the integrated marketing communications campaign. 
                    Promotion includes a variety of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/081616/can-i-make-money-advertising-my-car-or-it-scam.asp">activities such as advertising</a>, selling, 
                    sales promotions, public relations, direct marketing, sponsorship, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/guerrilla-marketing.asp">guerrilla marketing</a>.
                   </p>
                   <h2>Types of Marketing Strategies</h2>
                   <p>Marketing is comprised of an incredibly broad and 
                    diverse set of strategies. The industry continues to evolve, 
                    and the strategies below may be better suited for some companies over others
                </p>
                <h2>Traditional Marketing Strategies</h2>
                <p>Before technology and the Internet, traditional marketing was the
                   primary way companies would market their goods to customers. 
                The main types of traditional marketing strategies include:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Outdoor Marketing:</b> This entails public displays of advertising external to a consumer's house. 
                    This includes billboards, printed advertisements on benches, sticker wraps on vehicles, 
                    or advertisements on public transit.</li>
                    <li><b>Print Marketing:</b> This entails small, easily printed content that is easy to replicate. 
                        Traditionally, companies often mass-produced printed materials, as the printed content was the same for all customers. 
                        Today, more flexibility in printing processes means that materials can be differentiated</li>
                        <li><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/direct-marketing.asp">Direct Marketing:</a></b>This entails specific content delivered to potential customers. 
                            Some print marketing content could be mailed. 
                            Otherwise, direct marketing mediums could include coupons, vouchers for free goods, or pamphlets</li>
                            <li><b>Electronic Marketing:</b> This entails the use of TV and radio for advertising. Through short bursts of digital content, 
                                a company can convey information to a customer through visual or auditory media 
                                that may grab a viewer's attention better than a printed form.</li>
                                <li><b>Event Marketing:</b> This entails attempting to gather potential customers at a specific location for 
                                    the opportunity to speak with them about products or demonstrate products. 
                                    This includes conferences, trade shows, seminars, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roadshow.asp">roadshows</a>, or private events</li>
            </ul></p>
            <h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
            <p>The marketing industry has been forever changed with the introduction of digital marketing. 
                From the early days of pop-up ads to targeted placements based on viewing history, 
                there are now innovative ways companies can reach customers through digital marketing.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Search Engine Marketing:</b> This entails companies attempting to increase search traffic through two 
                    ways. First, companies can pay search engines for placement on result pages. 
                    Second, companies can emphasize search engine optimization (SEO) 
                    techniques to organically place high on search results.</li>
                    <li><b>E-mail Marketing:</b>This entails companies obtaining customer or potential customer 
                        e-mail addresses and distributing messages or newsletters. These messages can include coupons, 
                        discount opportunities, or advance notice of upcoming sales.</li>
                        <li><b>Social Media Marketing:</b>This entails <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/use-social-media-to-grow-business-8391642">building an online presence</a> on specific 
                            social media platforms. Like search engine marketing, companies can place 
                            paid advertisements to bypass algorithms and obtain a higher chance of being seen by viewers. 
                            Otherwise, a company can attempt to organically grow by posting content, 
                            interacting with followers, or uploading media like photos and videos.</li>
                            <li><b>Affiliate Marketing:</b>This entails using third-party advertising to drive customer interest. 
                                Often, an affiliate that will get a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commission.asp">commission</a> from a sale will do affiliate marketing as the 
                                third party is incentivized to drive a sale for a good that is not their own original product.</li>
                                <li><b>Content Marketing:</b>This entails creating content, whether eBooks, infographics, video seminars, 
                                    or other downloadable content. The goal is to create a product (often free) to share 
                                    information about a product, obtain customer information, 
                                    and encourage customers to continue with the company beyond the content.
                                </li>
                                <h2>What Are the Benefits of Marketing?</h2>
                                <p>Well-defined marketing strategies can benefit a company in several ways. 
                                    It may be challenging to develop the right strategy or execute the plan; when done well, 
                                    marketing can yield the following results:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Audience Generation:</b>Marketing allows a company to target specific people it believes will 
                                        benefit from its product or service. Sometimes, people know they have the need. Other times, 
                                        they don't realize it. Marketing enables a company to connect with a 
                                        cohort of people that fit the demographic of whom the company aims to serve</li>
                                        <li><b>Inward Education:</b>Marketing is useful for collecting information to be processed 
                                            internally to drive success. For example, consider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-research.asp">market research</a> that finds a 
                                            certain product is primarily purchased by women aged 18 to 34 years old. 
                                            By collecting this information, a company can better understand how to cater to this demographic, 
                                            drive sales, and be more efficient with resources.</li>
                                            <li><b>Outward Education:</b>Marketing can also be used to communicate with the world what your company does, 
                                                what products you sell, and how your company can enrich the lives of others. 
                                                Campaigns can be educational, informing those outside of your company why they need your product. 
                                                In addition, marketing campaigns let a company introduce itself, 
                                                its history, its owners, and its motivation for being the company it is</li>
                                            <li><b>Brand Creation:</b>Marketing allows for a company to take an offensive approach to creating a brand. 
                                                Instead of a customer shaping their opinion of a company based on their interactions, 
                                                a company can preemptively engage a customer with specific content or media to drive certain emotions <br> or reactions. 
                                                This allows a company to shape its image before the customer has ever interacted with its products.</li>
                                                <li><b>Long-lasting:</b>Marketing campaigns done right can have a long-lasting impact on customers. 
                                                    Consider Poppin' Fresh, also known as the Pillsbury Doughboy. <br>
                                                    First appearing in 1965, the mascot has helped create a long-lasting, warm, friendly brand for Pillsbury.</li>
                                                    <li><b>Financial Performance:</b>The ultimate goal and benefit of marketing are to drive sales. 
                                                        When relationships with customers are stronger, well-defined, and positive, customers are more 
                                                        likely to engage in sales. When marketing is done right, customers turn to your company, and you gain a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/competitive_advantage.asp">competitive advantage</a> over your competitors. 
                                                        Even if both products are exactly the same, marketing can create that competitive advantage for why a client picks you over someone else.</li>
                                </ul></p>   

            </ul></p>
